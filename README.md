# meteoHazard

An R package that turns meteorological data into **management-relevant predictions and warnings** for waste-management operations. It is part of the [`tidyWaste`](https://github.com/vorpalvorpal) family of packages.

## Functions

| Function | Hazard | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_twl()` | **Thermal Work Limit** — heat stress on workers | ✅ Implemented |
| `predict_odour()` | **Odour nuisance** — downwind odour dispersion | 🚧 Planned (stub) |
| `predict_litter()` | **Wind-blown litter** — material escaping the site boundary | 🚧 Planned (stub) |

## Installation

Install from GitHub using the `remotes` or `pak` package:

```r
# Using remotes
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("vorpalvorpal/meteoHazard")

# Using pak
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("vorpalvorpal/meteoHazard")
```

Or install from a local clone:

```r
# Clone the repository, then:
install.packages(".", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

### Dependencies

The package requires R (>= 4.1) and the following packages, which are installed automatically:

- `dplyr`
- `httr2`
- `cli`
- `purrr`

## Thermal Work Limit (TWL)

The **Thermal Work Limit (TWL)** is the maximum sustainable metabolic rate (W/m²) that well-hydrated, acclimatised workers can maintain in a thermally stressful environment. It implements the Brake & Bates (2002) methodology.

### Basic calculation (all parameters supplied)

```r
library(meteoHazard)

twl <- generate_twl(
  datetime     = as.POSIXct("2024-01-15 10:00:00", tz = "UTC"),
  latitude     = -31.95,
  longitude    = 115.86,
  temp         = 36,    # °C dry bulb
  wind_speed   = 0.5,   # m/s at body level
  RH           = 40,    # % relative humidity
  direct_solar = 600,   # W/m²
  diffuse_solar = 100,  # W/m²
  pressure     = 1013   # hPa
)
```

### Auto-fetch missing weather from Open-Meteo

Any weather parameter can be omitted and will be fetched automatically from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) (free, no API key required). An internet connection is required.

```r
twl <- generate_twl(
  datetime  = as.POSIXct("2024-01-15 10:00:00", tz = "UTC"),
  latitude  = -31.95,
  longitude = 115.86,
  temp      = 36
  # wind_speed, RH, direct_solar, diffuse_solar, pressure fetched from API
)
```

### Categorise results

```r
categorise_twl(twl)
# "Unrestricted", "Acclimatisation", "Buffer", or "Withdrawal"

twl_colour(twl)
# Hex colour codes for visualisation
```

### TWL Categories

| TWL (W/m²) | Category | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 220 | Unrestricted | Green |
| 140 – 220 | Acclimatisation | Amber |
| 115 – 140 | Buffer | Orange |
| < 115 | Withdrawal | Red |

## Odour prediction (planned)

`predict_odour()` will estimate odour-nuisance potential at downwind receptors by coupling source emissions with atmospheric dispersion (wind speed/direction and atmospheric stability). It is currently a stub and not yet implemented.

## Wind-blown litter (planned)

`predict_litter()` will estimate the risk of lightweight material becoming airborne and escaping the site boundary, driven by wind speed and gusts. It is currently a stub and not yet implemented.
